This solution creates a 2D array and iterates through each row to find the first available seat given some number of tickets. It uses a check to first see how many seats are available per row before searching for a seat. If the number of available seats is at least as large as the number of sought seats, it will traverse through that specific row, else return an empty list. 

Takes it some input.txt file, and returns and output.txt file with the row and seat number assigned per reservation.
